## Getting Started

1. Compile all Java files

```
javac *.java
```

2. Start the Server program on a chosen port

```
java Server [port]
```

3. Open a new command line window and start the Client class on the same port

```
[need examples]
```

5. Repeat steps 3-4 depending on the number of players in the game (max 5)


## Testing/Playing the Game

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

Once all players are connected, the game setup will begin. The scribe will be asked to choose a story. I have included 2 versions of the same story - I recommend "3littlepigs-short.txt" for quicker testing.
