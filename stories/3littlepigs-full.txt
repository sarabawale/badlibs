THE THREE LITTLE @[n]@S

Once upon a time . . . there were three little @[n]@, who left their mummy and daddy to see the world. All summer long, they roamed through the @[p]@ and over the @[p]@, playing games and having fun.

None were happier than the three little @[n]@s, and they @[av]@ made friends with everyone. Wherever they went, they were given a @[a]@ welcome, but as summer drew to a close, they realized that folk were @[vp]@ back to their usual jobs, and preparing for winter.

Autumn came and it began to rain. The three little @[n]@s started to feel they needed a real @[n]@. Sadly they knew that the fun was over now and they must set to work like the others, or they'd be left in the cold and rain, with no roof over their heads. They talked about what to do, but each decided for himself.

The laziest little @[n]@ said he'd build a @[n]@ @[n]@. "It will only take a day,' he said. The others disagreed. "It's too fragile," they said disapprovingly, but he refused to listen.

Not quite so lazy, the second little @[n]@ went in search of planks of @[a]@ @[n]@. "Clunk! Clunk! Clunk!" It took him two days to nail them together.

But the third little @[n]@ did not like the @[n]@ @[n]@. "That's not the way to build a @[n]@!" he said. "It takes time, patience and hard work to build a @[n]@ that is strong enough to stand up to wind, rain, and snow, and most of all, protect us from the wolf!"

The days went by, and the wisest little @[n]@'s @[n]@ took shape, @[n]@ by @[n]@. From time to time, his brothers visited him, saying with a chuckle: "Why are you working so hard? Why don't you come and play?"

But the stubborn @[n]@layer @[n]@ just said, "No. I shall finish my @[n]@ first. It must be solid and sturdy. And then I'll come and play!" he said. "I shall not be foolish like you! For he who laughs last, laughs longest!"

It was the wisest little @[n]@ that found the tracks of a big wolf in the neighbourhood. The little @[n]@s rushed home in alarm. Along came the wolf, scowling fiercely at the laziest @[n]@'s @[n]@ @[n]@.

"Come out!" ordered the wolf, his mouth watering. I want to speak to you!"

"I'd rather stay where I am!" replied the little @[n]@ in a tiny voice.

"I'll make you come out!" growled the wolf angrily, and puffing out his chest, he took a very deep breath. Then he blew with all his might, right onto the @[n]@. And all the @[n]@ the silly @[n]@ had heaped against some thin poles, fell down in the great blast.

Excited by his own cleverness, the wolf did not notice that the little @[n]@ had slithered out from underneath the heap of @[n]@, and was dashing towards his brother's @[n]@ @[n]@.

When he realized that the little @[n]@ was escaping, the wolf grew wild with rage. "Come back!" he roared, trying to catch the @[n]@ as he ran into the @[n]@ @[n]@.

The other little @[n]@ greeted his brother, shaking like a leaf. "I hope this @[n]@ won't fall down! Let's lean against the door so he can't break in!"

Outside, the wolf could hear the little @[n]@s' words. Starving as he was, at the idea of a two-course meal, he rained blows on the door. "Open up! Open up! I only want to speak to you!"

Inside, the two brothers wept in fear and did their best to hold the door fast against the blows. Then the furious wolf braced himself a new effort: he drew in a really enormous breath, and went ... WHOOOOO! The @[n]@ @[n]@ collapsed like a pack of cards.

Luckily, the wisest little @[n]@ had been watching the scene from the window of his own @[n]@ @[n]@, and he rapidly opened the door to his fleeing brothers. And not a moment too soon, for the wolf was already hammering furiously on the door.

This time, the wolf had grave doubts. This @[n]@ had a much more solid air than the others. He blew once, he blew again and then for a third time. But all was in vain. For the @[n]@ did not budge an inch.

The three little @[n]@s watched him and their fear began to fade. Quite exhausted by his efforts, the wolf decided to try one of his tricks. He scrambled up a nearby ladder, on to the roof to have a look at the chimney.

However, the wisest little @[n]@ had seen this ploy, and he quickly said: "Quick! Light the fire!" With his long legs thrust down the chimney, the wolf was not sure if he should slide down the black hole. It wouldn't be easy to get in, but the sound of the little @[n]@s' voices below only made him feel hungrier.

"I'm dying of hunger! I'm goin to try and get down." And he let himself drop. But landing was rather hot, too hot! The wolf landed in the fire, stunned by his fall. The flames licked his hairy coat and his tail became a flaring torch.

"Never again! Never again will I go down a chimney!" he squealed, as he tried to put out the flames in his tail. Then he ran away as fast as he could.

The three happy little @[n]@s, dancing round and round the yard, began to 
sing: "Tra-la-la! Tra-la-la! The wicked black wolf will never come back...!"

From that terrible day on, the wisest little @[n]@'s brothers set to work with a will. In less than no time, up went the two new @[n]@ @[n]@s.

The wolf did return once to roam in the neighbourhood, but when he caught sight of three chimneys, he remembered the terrible pain of a burnt tail, and he left for good.

Now safe and happy, the wisest little @[n]@ called to his brothers: "No more work! Come on, let's go and play!"
