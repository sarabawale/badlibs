THE THREE LITTLE @[n]@S

Once upon a time . . . there were three little @[n]@, who left their mummy and daddy to see the world. All summer long, they roamed through the @[p]@ and over the @[p]@, playing games and having fun.

None were happier than the three little @[n]@s, and they @[av]@ made friends with everyone. Wherever they went, they were given a @[a]@ welcome, but as summer drew to a close, they realized that folk were @[vp]@ back to their usual jobs, and preparing for winter.

Autumn came and it began to rain. The three little @[n]@s started to feel they needed a real @[n]@. Sadly they knew that the fun was over now and they must set to work like the others, or they'd be left in the cold and rain, with no roof over their heads. They talked about what to do, but each decided for himself.
