Final Project: "Badlibs"

Notes:

My original plan was to implement this in Android Studio, but I did not have a working app by the deadline so I've decided to submit the core code instead. This is the code I was attempting to adapt to the Android SDK. If you'd like to see what I did manage to do with the app, I can email it or upload it too Moodle.

SETUP:

1. Compile all java files in Terminal with the command 'javac *.java'
2. Start the Server program by calling 'java Server [port]'
3. Open a new Terminal window and start the Client class with 'java Client localhost [port]'
4. Enter information when prompted (there are checks for invalid input)
5. Repeat steps 3-4 depending on how many players you chose to have (max 5)

TESTING:
Once all players are connected, the game setup will begin. The scribe will be asked to choose a story. I have included 2 versions of the same story - I recommend "3littlepigs-short.txt" for quicker testing.
